# Python-Machine-Learning-notes

Python implementations of some of the fundamental Machine Learning methods and algorithms from scratch as well as using standard Machine Learning libraries. <br>

The purpose of this project is not to produce as optimized and computationally efficient algorithms as possible but rather to understand the inner workings, mathematics and the fundamental theories of these methods and algorithms.
